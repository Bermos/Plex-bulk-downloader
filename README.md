## Original author message
This is a first test for a Plex bulk downloader app. Browse to any album (music or photos) and click the extention icon and then download to start downloading the whole album.

Also this is my first draft for this extention. It is absolutely possible for it to contain bugs.

You can find the newest version on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coiigbmcndbjgabknjnaiangcommnnob).
